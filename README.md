# Exploring Hacker News Posts

This project was completed as part of the **Dataquest Data Analyst in Python** path.  
It explores user-submitted stories on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), with the goal of understanding what kinds of posts receive the most engagement (comments) and when they are typically posted.

## Objectives
1. Determine whether **“Ask HN”** or **“Show HN”** posts receive more comments on average.  
2. Identify **the best time of day** to post on Hacker News to maximize the number of comments.  
3. Gain experience in **data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis** using Python.
